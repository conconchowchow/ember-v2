"""
JIT Compilation and Execution Tracing for XCS Operators

This module provides a just-in-time (JIT) compilation system for Ember operators
through execution tracing. The @jit decorator transforms operator classes by
instrumenting them to record their execution patterns and automatically compile
optimized execution plans.

Key features:
1. Transparent operator instrumentation via the @jit decorator
2. Automatic execution graph construction from traced operator calls
3. Compile-once, execute-many optimization for repeated operations
4. Support for pre-compilation with sample inputs 
5. Configurable tracing and caching behaviors

Implementation follows functional programming principles where possible,
separating concerns between tracing, compilation, and execution. The design
adheres to the Open/Closed Principle by extending operator behavior without
modifying their core implementation.

Example:
    @jit
    class MyOperator(Operator):
        def __call__(self, *, inputs):
            # Complex, multi-step computation
            return result
            
    # First call triggers tracing and compilation
    op = MyOperator()
    result1 = op(inputs={"text": "example"})
    
    # Subsequent calls reuse the compiled execution plan
    result2 = op(inputs={"text": "another example"})

    """Just-In-Time compilation decorator for Ember Operators.

    The @jit decorator transforms Operator classes to automatically trace their execution
    and compile optimized execution plans. This brings significant performance benefits
    for complex operations and operator pipelines by analyzing the execution pattern
    once and reusing the optimized plan for subsequent calls.

    The implementation follows a lazily evaluated, memoization pattern:
    1. First execution triggers tracing to capture the full execution graph
    2. The traced operations are compiled into an optimized execution plan
    3. Subsequent calls reuse this plan without re-tracing (unless force_trace=True)
    
    Pre-compilation via sample_input is available for performance-critical paths where
    even the first execution needs to be fast. This implements an "eager" JIT pattern
    where compilation happens at initialization time rather than first execution time.

    Design principles:
    - Separation of concerns: Tracing, compilation, and execution are distinct phases
    - Minimal overhead: Non-tracing execution paths have negligible performance impact
    - Transparency: Decorated operators maintain their original interface contract
    - Configurability: Multiple options allow fine-tuning for different use cases

    Args:
        sample_input: Optional pre-defined input for eager compilation during initialization.
                    This enables "compile-time" optimization rather than runtime JIT compilation.
                    Recommended for performance-critical initialization paths.
        force_trace: When True, disables caching and traces every invocation.
                    This is valuable for debugging and for operators whose execution
                    pattern varies significantly based on input values. 
                    Performance impact: Significant, as caching benefits are disabled.
        recursive: Controls whether nested operator calls are also traced and compiled.
                 Currently limited to direct child operators observed during tracing.
                 Default is True, enabling full pipeline optimization.

    Returns:
        A decorator function that transforms the target Operator subclass by
        instrumenting its initialization and call methods for tracing.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If applied to a class that doesn't inherit from Operator.
                  The decorator strictly enforces type safety to prevent
                  incorrect usage on unsupported class types.

        @jit(sample_input={"text": "example"})  # Pre-compile with sample input

            def __call__(self, *, inputs):
